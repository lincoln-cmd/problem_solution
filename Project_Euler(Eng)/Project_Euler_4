[problem]
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
[/problem]



[explanation&code]

1. calculate all number from 1000 to 100 reversely

largest = 0
x, y = 0, 0

for a in range(1000, 100, -1):
    for b in range(1000, 100, -1):
        i = str(a * b)
        if i == ''.join(reversed(i)) and int(i) > largest:
            largest = int(i)
            x = a
            y = b
            
            
print(largest)
print(x, y)



2. calculate all number from 100 to 1000, and find largest result

largest = 0
x, y = 0, 0

for a in range(100, 1000):
    for b in range(100, 1000):
        i = str(a * b)
        if i == ''.join(reversed(i)) and int(i) > largest:
            largest = int(i)
            x, y = a, b
            
print(f'{x} * {y} = {largest}')



3. fro 1000 to 100, reversely, multiply two numbers. Once find the palindrome number, break the loop.

largest = 0
x, y = 0, 0

for a in range(1000, 100, -1):
    for b in range(1000, 100, -1):
        i = str(a * b)
        if i == ''.join(reversed(i)) and int(i) > largest:
            largest = int(i)
            x, y = a, b
            break
            
print('{} * {} = {}'.format(x, y, largest))
