[problem]
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?
[/problem]



[explanation]
- the function which check whether given number is prime number or not -> 1
- the function which find the n'th prime number -> 2

1. insert the given number n = 10001 in 2nd function
2. set the variables 'cnt(count)' and 'num(number)' as 0 and 1 in 2nd function, then through the while loop, while 'cnt' is smaller than 'n', insert 'num' which is distinguished number whether this is prime number or not, in 1st function.
3. through the 1st function, if 'num' is prime number, increase the 'cnt' by 1, if not, do not increase.
4. if 'cnt' is comparable with 'n', return the 'num' and finish the function.

[code]
def check(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def Prime(n):
    cnt = 0
    num = 1
    while cnt < n:
        num += 1
        if check(num) == True:
            cnt += 1
    return num

print(Prime(10001))
[/code]
