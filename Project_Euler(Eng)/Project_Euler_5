[problem]
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
[/problem]



[explanation]
Utilize the formula 'least common multiple'.
Import 'gcd(greatest common factor)' from math, which can help to find the gcd between two numbers, and 
repeat the employ of gcd function. To be more specific, find the gcd of two numbers 
in the array until the length of that to be 1.
[/explanation]



[code]
from math import gcd

def solution(arr):
    def lcm(x, y):
        return x * y // gcd(x, y)
    
    while True:
        arr.append(lcm(arr.pop(), arr.pop()))
        if len(arr) == 1:
            return arr[0]
        
li = [i for i in range(1, 21)]

print(solution(li))
